✅ **Instructions for you:**  
- Save the image you provided as `token-request.png`.  
- Place it inside a folder named `images/` at the root of your repository.  
- Commit both the `README.md` and the image so the GitHub Markdown will correctly display it.

If you want, I can help generate badges (like Maven, Java, Keycloak) or a flow diagram to make the README even more professional. Want me to add those? Let me know! 🚀
